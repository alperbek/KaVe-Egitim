# Invited Talk, Bogazici University
3 April 2019

I thank Prof. Haluk Bingol for inviting me to his course CMPE 557 COMPLEX SYSTEMS. We will mainly talk about `Why and how cooperation exists?`, `Is it good to have a huge memory?` via Prisoner's Dilemma Game. But first, we need some tools such as `Agent-based modeling` and `Data Science` to tackle this questions.

I dedicate this talk to Sea Squirts

# Future Directions
I strongly believe that data science and complex systems research should be merged. Please look at our [Complex systems and Data Science Workshop](https://uzay00.github.io/kahve/calistay/). In May 4th, we will organize our second workshop.  

> A very important future direction is to use Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents within Complex Systems.

# Extra Material 
If we have time, I also want to briefly talk about some data science projects. 

## Policial Data Science
 - [Turkey Political Opinions](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/uzay00/KaVe-Egitim/blob/master/KarmasikSistemler/Boun%20cmpe557%20Semınar/589_UzayCetin_YunusEmre.pdf)
